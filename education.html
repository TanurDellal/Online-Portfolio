                                        Every week, we coded short programs and had them assessed before personal deadlines. 
                                        Each exercise developed my punctuality, ability to organize time and plan head. 
                                        Each exercise also introduced different problems which needed to be solved
                                        - I did that no matter the complexity and so further refined my perseverance and problem-solving capabilities.
                                        This led to me achieving <b id="grade">86%</b> for my coursework mark.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Figure 1.1 demonstrates the most complex problem I was tasked to solve (the last assessed exercise for this module).
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Figure 1.2 & 1.3 showcases one of the methods belonging to my parsing calculator.
                                        It was extremely challenging to code this section as it required a complete understanding of each and every type of input the user could make.
                                        A series of if and else statements were used to lead each input down a different path and generate a different evaluation.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Before starting this program, I didn't know how to program using Java and also lots of other key concepts associated with programming. 
                                        I'm really happy I was given the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming with so many pleasant exercises.
                                        As a part of the coursework, we also had to complete a mini-project. Check out the Projects section for more info!

                                        Every week, I was given the opportunity to refine my knowledge on key computer architecture and computer network concepts.
                                        One of the most fascinating aspects to this was getting to see how the knowledge I built up is directly applied within working industries and why problems exist.

                                        Here, we were required to workout the values of high and low for the chained bit adders.

                                        The mid-term test was an excellent way to track our knowledge and understanding of the module content.

                                        Here we were given the opportunity to get a hands-on experience with assembly languages and how the CPU handles machine code.
                                        We wrote simple programs using MIPS and ended up modifying given pieces of code to, for example, alter the visual representation of a bitmap image by changing the colours stored within each pixel.
                                        I achieved 38.67/40.0 (an average of <b id="grade">97%</b>) for this module coursework.

                                        Figure 2.1 demonstrates the code which alters the colours within a bitmap image and stores it into new bitmap image file.
                                        This code specifically darkens the colour of each pixel by 50 points, resulting in the right-most image.

                                        There is a ton of computer system concepts I now know which I did not know before. 
                                        Gaining the ability to code using an assembly language as well as gaining relevant insight into real-world problems surrounding computer components, has been thoroughly enjoyable.
                                        An example of some interesting problems mentioned was DRAM's ability to hold a charge and access that charge quick enough.
                                        It is slower than SRAM and can leak charge over time making it really inefficient.

                                        Figure 3.1 demonstrates a lab question on box proofs, covering the logical operation: contra-constructive.
                                        Box proofs are a great way of proving that a propositional formula holds. Contra-constructive allows us to work backwards through the assumption of a propositional formula being false.
                                        From this, we derive a contradiction.

                                        It was challenging but extremely fun trying to achieve the shortest and most efficient box proof possible.
                                        18 lines was the shortest possible and was a satisfactory proof for the propositional formula.

                                        I did not know how to solve propositional formula using box proofs. 
                                        There are so many clever rules to ultilise in order to achieve the shortest proofs possible.
                                        Rules which I did not know about are for example the implication rule and then contra-constructive rule.

                                        In this module, I was tasked with three group assignments which took on the role of mini-projects.
                                        Hence, I will speak about them in more detail in the Projects section.
                                        My module grade successfully hit an average of <b id="grade">92%</b>, with my second project of the three reaching a total mark of <b id="grade">97%</b>.

                                        After completion of this module, I now know how to effectively research, dissect and use information to write a persuasive argument.
                                        Citing was also something new to me but came quite easy.
