                                    This project took on the form of a term-long assignment, designed to be improved upon throughout the whole of the module. 
                                    I was given the choice of different project themes and so decided on creating a procedural-style text-based game. 
                                    The game works in a way where the user must traverse through a mystical forest and heal various types of animals situated in various geographical terrains and atmospheres.

                                    <br>
                                    Throughout this project, I refined my ability to plan ahead and applied all of my knowledge of programming concepts into this one big game. 
                                    Due to an existing passion for gaming and decision-oriented games, I was highly motivated and interested right from the start of this project. 
                                    Compared to the weekly exercises, this assignment required more attention to detail and extended the bounds of my creativity.

                                <p>
                                    In 2021, I decided to start producing and uploading piano compositions.
                                    As a passionate piano player, I found that I loved to express myself through piano playing and composing.
                                    It was how I let my emotions flow through my fingertips into the keys and into the sound of music.
                                    Throughout this journey, I emotionally connected with every piece I wrote and so each song I produced had its own story to tell.
                                    The stories were accompanied by an atmosphere I tried to paint with emotions.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Shortly after I had some music prepared, I designed and managed own website and social media accounts, scheduling posts and song releases.
                                    I then marketed the piano pieces by running ad campaigns, reaching 4000+ listeners and 140+ link clicks. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    From piano playing, composition, atmospheric creation to web design and marketing research, I stretched my creativity and developed commercial awareness around artist branding and advertisement.
                                    I also gained good command of website design tools, understanding and adapting to trends.
                                    Organisational skills were massively developed as well.

                                    I completed 3 group assignments, whereby I took on a leadership role in one of them.
                                    This assignment focused on e-waste issues and solutions surrounding smartphones.
                                    As the project leader, I delegated tasks to 5 team members, organised group meetings and supervised the progress of the team.
                                    We each communicated effectively and provided constructive criticism to ensure the quality of work was up to the highest possible standards.
                                    Once our slides were ready, we practiced giving mock presentations - all of our efforts resulted in achieving a final 34/35.

                                    <br>
                                    Other skills I developed throughout all of my other assignments are researching, filtering out unnecessary information, and essay writing.
                                    The third assignment was a group technical thinking and writing task, focusing on problem definition where we developed a documented project idea.
                                    None of this could be done without the help of my teammates, so collaborating and working together played a huge part in this module's success.
