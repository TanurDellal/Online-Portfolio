            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a second-year student taking BSc Computer Science and am looking to dive deeper into the industry of tech.
                I am very passionate about software engineering, web development and probabilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of technology, anything to develop my interpersonal skills and self-development excite me.
                My passions extend to piano playing, gaming, problem solving (especially within a team) and researching new technologies.

            <h3>Key Strengths?</h3>
            <p>
                I believe I am good at embracing challenges and solving complex problems. 
                Coding, testing and learning to consider object-oriented designs are crucial skills I developed in writing programs for my first-year modules. 
                Working efficiently and communicating effectively within a team are core skills which I have improved upon dramatically since starting my university course. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Whenever I come across a problem, I persevere and make sure to exhaust all ideas and methods in trying to find a solution. 
                Thanks to this characteristic and also one of my first-year modules (Logic and Discrete Structures), I possess even stronger logical thinking skills.

            <h3>Current Ambitions?</h3>
            <p>
                My current ambitions are to explore various roles within the tech industry (especially software engineering) in order to guide me in the direction of my future career.
                I'm glad to have taken part in various opportunities & experiences in year 1. I will make sure to carry on - broadening my perspective and commercial awareness is very important to me.
